## Hands-on development notes
The information below guides you on different aspects of the development process. If you have
something which should be quickly available, please propose changes here.

### Architecture

The structure of directories:
```text
.
├── .workflows/    <- stores development scripts
├── bin/           <- stores executable which is entry point
├── completions/   <- stores completion files
├── docs/          <- stores user documentation
├── libexec/       <- contains all commands
├── tests/         <- stores all tests along with additional test libraries
└── workflows      <- executes different development tasks
```

When you run `git elegant ...`, it initiates `bin/git-elegant` entry-point script. It calls
`libexec/git-elegant` which is responsible for the execution of a given command by loading the code
of a desired command (using a command file like `libexec/git-elegant-<command>`) and executing
it. Each command file has to provide the following BASH functions:
- `command-name` prints a command name (line length is limited to 50 characters)
- `command-synopsis` prints a `usage` statement (line length is limited to 80 characters)
- `command-description` prints a command description (line length is limited to 80 characters)
- `default` executes given command

### Development environment
The following tools are needed for successful development:
- Docker >= 19.03.2 is used for running tests
- Python 3.x is needed for documentation previews
- Elegant Git automates testing process and documentation generation

### Coding rules
We enforce having a consistent implementation by following the next strict rules:
- add `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the beginning of each script
- use whether `git-verbose` or `git-verbose-op` instead of `git` command for well-formatted outputs
- a private function (a usage in the scope of current script) should be prefixed with `--`

If you need to write a message to the system output, please use public functions in
[libexec/plugins/text](libexec/plugins/text). All help messages have to use `cat`
for printing them.

### Debug mode
You can enable debug mode by running `export GED=1` (the equivalent of `set -x` for `bash`).
Run `unset GED` to switch debug off.

### Testing procedure
A testing procedure consists of 3 steps:
1. unit testing using [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
2. installation testing
3. validation of documentation correctness
4. validation of todo' correctness (for [0pdd](http://www.0pdd.com/p?name=bees-hive/elegant-git))

All these steps can be executed by `./workflows ci` which runs a Docker container (based on
`beeshive/elegant-git-ci` image) and calls all described checks. The image is also used on CI.
If the image requires modifications, then

1. run `./workflows prepare-worker <new tag>` to build a new image
2. update `WORKER_IMAGE` in `./workflows` and test some workflow
3. run `./workflows publich-worker <new tag>`  to push the image

### Unit testing
#### Addons
In order to have a working unit tests, you need to add `load addons-common` line to each `.bats`
file. This addon configures right access to executables (`libexec` directory) and defines mandatory
functions.

Also, there are several optional addons which can be useful in some circumstances:
- add `load addons-repo` to interact with real git repository
- add `load addons-fake` to fake a Linux command
- add `load addons-cd`   to fake `cd` command
- add `load addons-read` to fake `read` command

#### Writing tests
1. **Use `setup()` or `teardown()`** bats methods only in the tests.
2. Use **`check` instead of bats `run`** to execute a command to be tested.
3. Use **`perform-verbose`** to execute any real command within a test which should not be tested.
4. Use appropriate `*-clean` function within a `teardown()` method if the addon provides it.
5. Do not fake `git-elegant` commands within the tests.

#### Assertions
- `[[ ${status} -eq 2 ]]` for a command status
- `[[ ${#lines[@]} -eq 0 ]]` for a length of command output
- `[[ ${lines[0]} = "+ the space " ]]` for an output line (index starts from 0)
- `[[ ${lines[@]} =~ "exact string" ]]` for an output line within whole output

#### Test name template
Use the following test name template - `'<command>': <describes the behavior that will be tested>`
like `'clone-repository': stops with exit code 45 if cloneable URL is not set`.

The behavior should be descriptive-style (`stops with exit code 45 if cloneable URL is not set`)
rather than imperative-style (`stop with exit code 45 if cloneable URL is not set`).

### Updating documentation
In order to get the documentation preview locally, please install required dependencies with
`pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`. After, run `./workflows serve-docs`. That's it!

The [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md) generates by running `./workflows generate-docs` script.
All other files in ["docs" directory](docs/) require manual corrections.

### Completions testing
1. source updated competion file
    - bash: `source completions/git-elegant.bash`
    - zsh: `source completions/_git-elegant`
2. run `git-elegant <some>` and press Tab twice
