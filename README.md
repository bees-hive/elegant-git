## Hands-on development notes
The information below guides you on different aspects of the development process. If you have
something which should be quickly available, please propose changes here.

### Architecture

The structure of directories:
```text
.
├── bin           <- stores executable which is entry point
├── completions   <- stores completion files
├── docs          <- stores user documentation
├── libexec       <- contains all commands
└── tests         <- stores all tests along with additional test libraries
```

When you run `git elegant ...`, it initiates `bin/git-elegant` entry-point script. It calls
`libexec/git-elegant` which is responsible for the execution of a given command by loading the code
of a desired command (using a command file like `libexec/git-elegant-<command>`) and executing
it. Each command file has to provide the following BASH functions:
- `command-name` prints a command name (line length is limited to 50 characters)
- `command-synopsis` prints a `usage` statement (line length is limited to 80 characters)
- `command-description` prints a command description (line length is limited to 80 characters)
- `default` executes given command

### Coding rules
We enforce having a consistent implementation by following the next strict rules:
- add `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the beginning of each script
- use `git-verbose` instead of `git` if you need to print a `git`'s command to CLI
- a private function (a usage in the scope of current script) should be prefixed with `--`

If you need to write a message to the system output, please use public functions in
[libexec/plugins/text](libexec/plugins/text). All help messages have to use `cat`
for printing them.

### Debug mode
You can enable debug mode by running `export GED=1` (the equivalent of `set -x` for `bash`). 
Run `unset GED` to switch debug off. 

### Testing procedure
A testing procedure consists of 3 steps:
1. unit testing using [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
2. installation testing
3. validation of documentation correctness
4. validation of todo' correctness (for [0pdd](http://www.0pdd.com/p?name=bees-hive/elegant-git))

All these steps can be executed by
`docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/eg beeshive/elegant-git-ci:3 ./quality-pipeline.bash testing`.

`beeshive/elegant-git-ci` Docker image is also used on CI. If the image requires modifications,
it has to be updated manually by the following instructions:
1. update `Dockerfile` (including `version` and `description`)
2. `docker build -t beeshive/elegant-git-ci:<version> .`
3. `docker push beeshive/elegant-git-ci:<version>`

### Unit testing
#### Addons
In order to have a working unit tests, you need to add `load addons-common` line to each `.bats`
file. This addon configures right access to executables (`libexec` directory) and defines mandatory
functions.

Also, there are several optional addons which can be useful in some circumstances:
- add `load addons-git`  to interact with real git repository
- add `load addons-fake` to fake a Linux command
- add `load addons-cd`   to fake `cd` command
- add `load addons-read` to fake `read` command

#### Writing tests
1. **Use `setup()` or `teardown()`** bats methods only in the tests.
2. Use **`check` instead of bats `run`** to execute a command to be tested.
3. Use **`testtee`** to execute any real command within a test which should not be tested.
4. If `addons-fake` or `addons-git` is used, call `clean-fake` or `clean-git` within a `teardown()` method.
5. Do not fake `git-elegant` commands within the tests.

#### Assertions
- `[[ "${lines[0]}" = "+ the space " ]]` for an output line (index starts from 0)
- `[[ "$status" -eq 2 ]]` for a command status
- `[[ "${#lines[@]}" -eq 0 ]]` for a length of command output
- `[[ "${lines[@]}" =~ "exact string" ]]` for an output line within whole output

#### Test name template
Use the following test name template - `'<command args>': <describe what will be tested>` like
`'clone-repository': raise an error if cloneable URL isn't set`.

### Updating documentation
In order to get the documentation preview locally, please install required dependencies with 
`pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`. After, run `mkdocs serve` and open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> 
in a browser. That's it!

The [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md) generates by running `./.wf/docs-generation.bash` script.
All other files in ["docs" directory](docs/) require manual corrections.
