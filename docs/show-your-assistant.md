# Show your assistant

If you use Elegant Git - it means that you have a great assistant for your daily routine. And you
can say about it by including a badge to your README file. It looks like this:

[![git assistant: Elegant Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/assistant-Elegant%20Git-000000.svg)](https://github.com/bees-hive/elegant-git)

Add the following line to project’s README.md:
